# MCP v3 Provider Context

Use this helper before any provider task where the account, client, connection, campaign, or Workspace project is not already exact.

## Required Sequence

1. Resolve provider scope with the top-level meta-tools:
   - account/client/project unknown: `get_provider_context({ provider, query? })`;
   - exact Yandex Direct login known: `get_provider_context({ provider: "yandex", query?, client_login })`.
   - campaign named by user: `resolve_campaign_scope({ provider, query, workspace_project_id? })`.
2. Find internal provider tools with `search_tools`, passing resolved provider/project scope when supported.
3. Read each internal tool schema with `get_tool_schema` before its first call.
4. Copy only returned `tool_args`, `scope_arguments`, or `next_call.arguments` into the internal provider call.
5. Read with `call_tool`; write with `call_write_tool`.

Call `search_tools`, `get_tool_schema`, `get_provider_context`, and `resolve_campaign_scope` directly. Never pass these top-level meta-tools as `tool_name` to `call_tool` or `call_write_tool`.

## Scope Rules

- Do not infer `client_login`, `client_id`, `account_id`, `counter_id`, `host_id`, or `connection_id` from a human name.
- `query` is free project/name/INN/display-identifier search. For Yandex, put an exact Direct login only in `client_login`; both fields may be sent together and are resolved independently.
- Legacy clients may still put a syntactically valid Yandex login in `query`, but it is only a compatibility candidate and must pass the same exact live-directory check.
- Inspect `scope_issues`. Automatically execute only a read-only `next_action` with `may_execute_automatically=true`. Never bypass `manual_scope_review`, ambiguity, conflict, directory outage, or login-not-found by guessing arguments.
- An `external_entity_key`, project name, or `external_entity_name` is never executable `client_login`; copy only returned `tool_args`, `scope_arguments`, or `next_call.arguments`.
- If `resolve_campaign_scope` returns candidates, ask for the exact `workspace_project_id` or campaign id.
- If it returns `not_observed`, use its typed `diagnosis`: `api_visibility` records exactly which public sources returned no object or rows, while successful provider access rules out an observed OAuth failure only for `checked_scopes`. Read `checked_scopes[].selection`: `explicit` means the caller named that cabinet through `connection_id` or `client_login`; `workspace_project_id` alone is a memory boundary and always stays `discovered`. When every checked scope is `explicit`, `yandex_client_login.status=not_required_for_explicit_scope` and `next_action.kind=none`: do not propose reconnecting OAuth, another period, another `client_login`, or the same reads without new evidence. When any scope was `discovered` and another Yandex account is genuinely possible, `yandex_client_login.status=provide_if_campaign_is_in_another_account`: request its exact `client_login`, and after informed confirmation use only the prepared `save_yandex_client_account` write call, then resolve again. Branch on the typed `status`, never on `reason` prose. Do not infer an unsupported campaign type or an empty web account from an empty API result.
- For campaign write in agency/team Пространства, include `workspace_project_id` unless preflight returned one unambiguous scope.
- If provider context says a tool is available only in a selected Пространство, fail closed and ask for that project id.

## Provider Keys

- Yandex Direct: `connection_id`, optional `client_login`.
- Metrika: `counter_id`, optional `connection_id`; no `client_login`.
- VK Ads: `connection_id`, optional `client_id`.
- Avito Ads: `connection_id`, optional 9-digit `account_id`.
- Yandex Webmaster: start with `webmaster_get_hosts`, then `host_id`; no `client_login`.
- LidFly sites: `subdomain`, site id, or store id from returned tool args.

## Output

Tell the user which scope was selected in human terms and include the exact id only when useful for audit: `workspace_project_id`, provider account, campaign id. Do not expose tokens or secrets.
