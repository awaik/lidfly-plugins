# VK Ads Campaign Builder

Use for VK Ads campaigns, ad groups, banners, lead forms, statistics, audiences, contextual phrases, budgets, statuses, and creative checks.

## v3 Scope First

1. Search with `search_tools({ provider: "vk", query })`.
2. Read schemas with `get_tool_schema`.
3. If account/client is unclear, call `get_provider_context({ provider: "vk", query? })`.
4. If campaign is named, call `resolve_campaign_scope({ provider: "vk", query, workspace_project_id? })`.
5. Use only returned `connection_id`, `client_id`, `workspace_project_id`, and `scope_arguments`.
6. Read via `call_tool`; write via `call_write_tool`.

## VK Account Rules

- `connection_id` selects VK OAuth connection.
- `client_id` selects agency/manager/client account.
- Manual VK user-filter is allowed only when it appears in provider context; do not pass arbitrary VK user ids.
- In manual user-filter mode, creation/upload/single update may be unavailable; prefer allowed mass actions and reread state.
- For `max_goals` bidding, use `max_price` when updating limits; reread the group after write.

## Write Safety

Before any campaign or ad-group write, read [VK goal mode and write safety](references/goal-mode.md). It is the source of truth for `checked_packages.goal_mode`, `priced_goal`, bootstrap groups and ambiguous outcomes.

The compact legacy provider projection is [methodology](references/methodology.md).

## Analytics

Before evaluating statistics, CPA, reach, budget distribution, missing impressions or a reach forecast, read [VK Ads analytics](references/analytics.md). Tool descriptions carry no evaluation thresholds; judgment comes from that reference and the client's goals in project memory.

## Phrase Expansion

Offer `search_phrase_vectorization` only when the user wants broader reach from contextual phrases; do not enable it as a default optimization. Explain the audience change before confirmation, use a phrase segment in `targetings.segments`, and reread the field after creation. Manual user-filter does not support this setting. An unconfirmed write must not be repeated. Source: [VK AdGroup API](https://ads.vk.ru/doc/api/object/AdGroup), local documentation checked 2026-09-26; live reads on the own account accepted `fields` but omitted this field, so absence is not proof of `false`.

## Creative And Text

- Validate package/banner pattern before creating banners.
- Avoid unsupported symbols in text; keep copy within VK field limits.
- Upload images/videos only after source asset is final.
- Do not replace complete banner sections unless the schema requires it and current content has been reread.

## Workspace

Save decisions, campaign snapshots, analytics summaries, and follow-up scheduled tasks only after resolving `workspace_project_id`.

## Google Export

When the user asks to export a VK Ads report to Google Sheets or Google Docs, keep this skill for account/campaign scope and report reads, then hand the verified Google write and reread to `$export-ad-reports`.

The export handoff applies only when this host exposes the skill and a Google write connector. If either is unavailable, state the exact missing capability and return the requested report as a draft; do not claim a saved Google file or silently switch to Workspace.
